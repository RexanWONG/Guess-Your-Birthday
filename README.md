# Guess-Your-Birthday
Java Program that can accurately guess your birthday

You can find out the data of the month when you were born by asking five questions.  Each question asks whether the day is one of the five sets, displayed on the console , of numbers.  

The birthday is calculated by the sum of the first numbers in the sets where the day appears.  For example, if the birthday is 8, it may appear in 3/5 of the sets.  The first numbers in these sets which 8 is found will be added up, the sum of the three numbers will be 8.  

The Java program prompts the user to answer whether the day is in the first set, etc.  If the umber is in the set, the program adds the first number in the set to the int variable day.
